# WEEK 4: File Read & Write with Error Handling in Python

This is a simple Python program I wrote while learning **file handling** and **error handling**.  
It asks the user for a filename, reads the file, modifies its contents, and saves the result into a **new file**.  

## Features
- Asks the user to type a filename.
- Reads the file if it exists.
- Converts all text to **UPPERCASE** (you can change this to other modifications).
- Handles common errors such as:
  - File not found. 
  - Permission denied. 
  - Other unexpected errors.

# WEEK 3 Assignment: Discount Calculator in Python

## 📌 Assignment Description
Create a function named `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that calculates the final price after applying a discount.  
The function should take the original price (`price`) and the discount percentage (`discount_percent`) as parameters.  

- If the discount is **20% or higher**, apply the discount.  
- Otherwise, return the original price.  

Using the `calculate_discount` function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage.  
Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

---

## 🚀 Solution Overview
The program is divided into two parts:
1. **Function Definition**  
   - `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` checks if the discount is at least 20%.  
   - If true, it applies the discount and returns the reduced price.  
   - If false, it simply returns the original price.

2. **User Interaction**  
   - Prompts the user to enter the original price of an item.  
   - Prompts the user to enter the discount percentage.  
   - Calls the function and prints the final result.

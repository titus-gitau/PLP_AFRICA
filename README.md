# WEEK 3 Assignment: Discount Calculator in Python

## 📌 Assignment Description
Create a function named `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that calculates the final price after applying a discount.  
The function should take the original price (`price`) and the discount percentage (`discount_percent`) as parameters.  

- If the discount is **20% or higher**, apply the discount.  
- Otherwise, return the original price.  

Using the `calculate_discount` function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage.  
Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

## 🚀 Solution Overview
The program is divided into two parts:
1. **Function Definition**  
   - `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` checks if the discount is at least 20%.  
   - If true, it applies the discount and returns the reduced price.  
   - If false, it simply returns the original price.

2. **User Interaction**  
   - Prompts the user to enter the original price of an item.  
   - Prompts the user to enter the discount percentage.  
   - Calls the function and prints the final result.
